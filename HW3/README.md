STAT 159 HW3 - Multiple Regression Analysis

This is homework 3 of STAT 159, held in fall 2016. This homework is the extention of HW2 where we reproduced the analysis of Simple Linear Regression. Here, we want to reproduce Multiple Linear Regression, found in section 3.2 of the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learing" by James et al, in addition to writing some functions and unit tests.

There will be the following folders:
* code
	* functions
	* scripts
	* tests
* data
* images
* report

To reproduce this paper, you will need to clone this repo, download the data Advertising.csv, and run the Makefile.
