STAT 159 Lab 8

This is Lab 8 of STAT 159. This lab requires us to create a ShinyDoc that plots scatterplot of sales vs. different advertising channels. The plot displayed will be configured by the selection of items in a dropdown.
The inputs are TV, Radio, or Newspaper, and the output is Sales.

To reproduce this lab, changes can be made on the app.R file.
