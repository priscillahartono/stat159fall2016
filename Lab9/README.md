STAT 159 Lab 9 - Simple Regression Analysis

This is Lab 9 of STAT 159. This lab requires us to rewrite HW 2 using Rnw file format and convert it into a LaTex document.
The files in this folder are:
* This README.md file
* Supporting files
	* scatterplot-tv-sales.png
	* regression.RData
* Lab9.Rnw: the code
* Lab9.pdf: the LaTex output

Running Lab9.Rnw will produce a simple regression analysis and output in pdf version.

To reproduce this lab, clone this repo and run Lab9.Rnw in RStudio.
