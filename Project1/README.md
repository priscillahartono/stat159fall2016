STAT 159 Project 1

![STAT159 logo](/Project1/images/stat159-logo.png)

This is project 1 of STAT 159, held in Fall 2016. The project requires us to write a paper about the tools we have learnt in class: bash, markdown, pandoc, git, github, Make, and a text editor of our preference, which I used nano.

To reproduce this paper, the tools mentioned above are needed, and Makefile is used to compile the main part of the report.  The code 

	make

does this for us. We then want to push all the changes to GitHub to keep them centralized and allow collaboration to happen.
