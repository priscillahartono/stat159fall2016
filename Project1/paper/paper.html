<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>This report is the first project of STAT 159, Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science, taught by Professor Gaston Sanchez in the fall of 2016 at UC Berkeley. STAT 159 focuses on the collaborative work and the ability to reproduce valuable data.</p>
<p>There will be 4 parts in this report: abstract, introduction, discussion, and conclusion, where computational tools we have covered in class will be practiced and explained in some depth. The computational tools are Makefile, Git, GitHub, pandoc, and Markdown.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Reproducibility is an ongoing issue today. It is important that a scientific finding is reproducible, meaning the entire experiment or study should be able to produce the same results when the same researcher or other researchers redo it. With the numerous amount of information we can find today, we cannot trust everything we see. Hence, having reproducible data is extremely important. A lot of articles on the web often include how many times the experiment was repeated and how they produced similar results, therefore proving reproducibility.</p>
<p>The objective of this report is to practice with the computational tools we have covered in class: bash, Markdown, pandoc, Git, GitHub, Make, and a text editor (nano). I will firstly give a brief explanation of what Makefile, Git, GitHub, pandoc, and Markdown does, followed by some example and last but not least, discuss the roles each tool plays in reproducing data.</p>
<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<h3 id="makefile">Makefile</h3>
<p>Makefile organizes code compilation. It is a list of shell commands or a list of rules that tells the system what to do. Makefile is made through terminal and a text editor. Hence, we should make sure we have these programs installed. To test it out, type make in terminal.</p>
<p>Makefile files are usually named ‘Makefile.’ I personally use nano as my text editor, hence, the code I would type in terminal to create a Makefile is:</p>
<p>nano Makefile</p>
<p>Inside the text editor, there is a specific format: target: source</p>
<pre><code>commands</code></pre>
<p>To execute, type ‘make.’ This would compile all the codes are run them as a whole.</p>
<p>The advantage of using Makefile is that we can edit multiple files and Makefile helps compile all of them.</p>
<h3 id="git">Git</h3>
<p><img src="sections/Project1/images/git-logo.png" alt="Git logo" /> Git is a version control system. It stores the revisions of projects users are working on in a central repository by taking “snapshots.” It also allows users to collaborate very easily. It allows users to track their changes by committing to these changes and they’ll be stored.</p>
<p>To use Git, we should know some basic codes:</p>
<p>git add .</p>
<p>git commit –m “message”</p>
<p>git add adds all the content into the working tree, git commit saves the changes.</p>
<p>The advantage of using Git is that we can track our previous changes and collaboration is very easy.</p>
<h3 id="github">GitHub</h3>
<p><img src="sections/Project1/images/github-logo.png" alt="GitHub logo" /> GitHub is a Git repository hosting service. It provides a central repository for all files associated with a project where code sharing and publishing is involved. It allows users to make changes in their local copy then push it into the central repository when they are satisfied with the changes they made.</p>
<p>To save the changes made locally to the central repository, we use:</p>
<p>git push origin branch</p>
<p>git push permanently saves the changes into GitHub.</p>
<p>GitHub and Git work together a lot, hence the benefit of using them are somewhat similar.</p>
<h3 id="pandoc">pandoc</h3>
<p><img src="sections/Project1/images/pandoc-logo.png" alt="pandoc logo" /> Pandoc converts one markup format to another. Just to name a few, it can read Markdown, CommonMark, HTML, LaTex, CommonMark, PHP Markdown Extra, etc. and can write Markdown, Word docx, LaTex, Textile, etc. For instance, for this report, we convert from Markdown to HTML using the following code:</p>
<p>pandoc paper.md –s –o paper.html</p>
<p>The –s represents producing a standalone document and the –o represents the output file. Meanwhile, like Makefile, some computer requires users to download the pandoc software, in addition to other softwares like LaTex to output text files. After downloading all the required software, we are ready to convert files.</p>
<p>The advantages of using pandoc is that we can have numerous different outputs without having to remake them. I realize that when I want to output a report, it is at times better to output a HTML file and other times better to output a text editor file. Hence, pandoc will come really handy here.</p>
<h3 id="markdown">Markdown</h3>
<p><img src="sections/Project1/images/markdown-logo.png" alt="Markdown logo" /> Markdown is a markup language that helps format text. It creates rich text using a plain text editor where users can bold, italicize, put in pictures, links, create tables, etc. A lot of its syntax corresponds to HTML. Below are some syntax that Markdown can do:</p>
<p>Create bullet lists:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create 1st header:</p>
<ul>
<li><h1 id="heading-1">Heading 1</h1></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Create 2nd header:</p>
<ul>
<li><h2 id="heading-2">Heading 2</h2></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Italicize:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>italic</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Bold:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>bold</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The advantage of using Markdown is that no additional software is needed to make changes to the text and the codes are rather simple as compared to other programming languages.</p>
<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
<p>I did all the coding in Terminal. But before that, I had to download pandoc and create a GitHub account.</p>
<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>For me personally, downloading the images was the easiest part. I made use of curl and just copied and pasted the url. Meanwhile, the most challenging part would be the very start. Creating the structure of the project was the most time consuming and I got stuck on it multiple times during the lab section and when I was continuing it at home. Pushing the committed file to GitHub took me multiple attempts because I was pushing it from the project folder instead of from the main repo. In the end, I created a new repo since the previous one had to many folders that I actually did not need. Sindhuja definitely helped a lot during the lab section and I googled a lot too. As a whole project, it took me the whole lab section, 2 hours, and I believe another 4 to 5 hours at home.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The project, as a whole, definitely made me understand GitHub better. It allowed me to put together the pieces of the puzzle and create a final output where each computational tool compliment each other. Before, just using terminal to move files and copy files did not make sense to me, but after this project, seeing how everything comes together made me appreciate the existing tools. Overall, it was a great project that cleared up a lot of misunderstandings I had.</p>
