This report is the first project of STAT 159, Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science, taught by Professor Gaston Sanchez in the fall of 2016 at UC Berkeley. STAT 159 focuses on the collaborative work and the ability to reproduce valuable data.

This report will consist of 4 parts: abstract, introduction, discussion, and conclusion, where computational tools we have covered in class will be practiced and explained in some depth. The computational tools are Makefile, Git, GitHub, pandoc, and Markdown.
