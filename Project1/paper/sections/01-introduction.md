Reproducibility is an ongoing issue today. It is important that a scientific finding is reproducible, meaning the entire experiment or study should be able to produce the same results when the same researcher or other researchers redo it. With the numerous amount of information we can find today, we cannot trust everything we see. Hence, having reproducible data is extremely important. A lot of articles on the web often include how many times the experiment was repeated and how they produced similar results, therefore proving reproducibility. 

The objective of this report is to practice with the computational tools we have covered in class: bash, Markdown, pandoc, Git, GitHub, Make, and a text editor (nano). I will firstly give a brief explanation of what Makefile, Git, GitHub, pandoc, and Markdown does, followed by some example and last but not least, discuss the roles each tool plays in reproducing data.
